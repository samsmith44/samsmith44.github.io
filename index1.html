	As an artist mostly accustomed to art through drawing, working digitally, especially through the means of foreign programs has proven to be quite the challenge for me. The beginning of the semester had a focus on programs that I was already familiar with, such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. As I was faced with more complex assignments and we strayed away from these familiar programs, there was the task of learning something I never in a million years thought I would ever even touch on: code. 
	
	Here is the body of work I created throughout the semester. With an emphasis on social media and the complexities of the digital realm, I was able to create exciting works of art that are intricate in meaning while maintaining visual aesthetic.
