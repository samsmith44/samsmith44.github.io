	<p id="statement"><br>
	As an artist mostly accustomed to art through drawing, working digitally, especially through the means of foreign programs has proven to be quite the challenge for me. The beginning of the semester had a focus on programs that I was already familiar with, such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. As I was faced with more complex assignments and we strayed away from these familiar programs, there was the task of learning something I never in a million years imagined I would ever even touch on: code. 
	<br>
	Here is the body of work I created throughout the semester. With an emphasis on social media and the complexities of the digital realm, I was able to create exciting works of art that are intricate in meaning while maintaining visual aesthetic. 
	<br>
	While many of the projects for the class were very fun and captivating for me, I'd have to say my favorite assignment of the semester was the glitch assignment. Although it is most definitely the most simple art assignment of the semester, I have a tendency to invest myself in artwork that has a focus on composition and color. 
	<br>
	As for the coding assignemnts, I found this portion of the class to be difficult. As someone who had never been introduced to coding before, learning it at such a fast pace made it even more challenging. Despite this, I feel I was able to broaden my understanding of code and at least understand the fundamentals. The processing assignments were also very fun to create and actually inspires me to explore more in the world of code and potentially learning web design.
